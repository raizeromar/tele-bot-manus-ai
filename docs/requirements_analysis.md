# Telegram AI Agent - Requirements Analysis

## Project Overview
The Telegram AI Agent is designed to act as a real user in Telegram groups, collecting messages over a week, summarizing them using AI, and providing a dashboard for users to manage and deploy these agents to specific accounts.

## Key Components

### 1. Telegram Integration
- **Functionality**: Join Telegram groups as a "real" user, monitor and collect all messages
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Telethon library for Telegram client API
  - Authentication mechanism for Telegram accounts
  - Message collection and storage system
  - Scheduled weekly collection process

### 2. AI Summarization
- **Functionality**: Process and summarize collected messages using AI
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Integration with Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model
  - Text processing pipeline for message preparation
  - Summary generation algorithm
  - Storage system for summaries

### 3. User Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Allow users to view summaries and manage AI agents
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Summary display interface
  - Agent management controls
  - Account connection interface

## Tech Stack Breakdown

### Backend
- **Django & Django REST Framework**: Main application framework and API
- **Telethon**: Telegram client library for interacting as a real user
- **Celery + Redis**: Task scheduling for periodic summarization
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing messages, summaries, and user data

### AI Component
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: AI model for summarization

### Frontend
- **Next.js (React + TypeScript)**: Frontend framework for the dashboard
- **Chakra UI / Tailwind CSS**: UI styling libraries

### Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **VPS**: Hosting environment
- **PostgreSQL + Redis**: Production database and queue system

## System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Telegram Integration collects messages from groups
2. Messages are stored in PostgreSQL database
3. Celery scheduled tasks trigger weekly summarization
4. AI model processes messages and generates summaries
5. Summaries are stored in the database
6. User Dashboard retrieves and displays summaries and agent status

### Component Interaction
- Backend provides REST APIs for the frontend
- Celery workers handle background and scheduled tasks
- Telethon clients connect to Telegram API
- Database stores all persistent data

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of Telegram account credentials
- User authentication for dashboard access
- API security for backend endpoints
- Data privacy for collected messages

## Performance Requirements
- Efficient message collection without API rate limiting
- Optimized database queries for large message volumes
- Responsive dashboard interface

## Scalability Considerations
- Support for multiple Telegram accounts and groups
- Efficient handling of increasing message volumes
- Horizontal scaling capability for backend services

## Next Steps
After this analysis, we will proceed with setting up the development environment and implementing each component according to the project plan.
